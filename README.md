## Download a File


</div>

### Description

This program downloads a file. It was very easy to do. I have been looking for one that works with my IE proxy and couldn't find one. They all used my 2nd proxy server instad of the first, or they asked my for the server IP, The way I have it set it will use the IE proxy to download my files, and leave the second server for Netscape. (I have one connection for IE and another for Netscape, for reasons you don't need to know)

Download it and try it. Works great.
 
### More Info
 
Have IE5.X installed on PC.

None Known of.
